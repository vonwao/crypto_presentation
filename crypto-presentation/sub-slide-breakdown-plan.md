## üìä Summary Impact

**Current State:** 13 navigable slides
**After Implementation:** 22 navigable slides

**Breakdown by Topic:**
- **Intro:** 1 slide (unchanged)
- **Hash Functions:** 2 sub-slides (existing)
- **Digital Signatures:** 6 sub-slides (3 existing + 3 new)
- **Merkle Trees:** 6 sub-slides (3 existing + 3 new) 
- **Blockchain:** 6 sub-slides (0 existing + 6 new)

## üéØ Benefits of This Approach

1. **Consistent Pattern:** Each major topic gets 3 sub-slides (except intro)
2. **Logical Flow:** Each sub-slide focuses on a specific concept or process
3. **Small Screen Friendly:** Reduces content density per screen
4. **Natural Sections:** Breaks align with existing content structure and animations
5. **Maintains Narrative:** Each sub-slide tells a complete story while building toward the next

## üîÑ Implementation Strategy

Each sub-slide would:
- Maintain the same animation system but focus on specific sections
- Use the existing `createSubSlideHTML()` method pattern
- Filter content based on the `sections` array in slide definitions
- Preserve the visual consistency and branding

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Update Slide Definitions
- Add `subSlides` arrays to remaining slide definitions in `presentation.js`
- Define section mappings for content filtering
- Update flattened slide count (13 ‚Üí 22 slides)

### Phase 2: Implement Sub-Slide HTML Generation
- Add `createSubSlideHTML()` methods to each slide class
- Implement section filtering logic
- Ensure animations work correctly for sub-slide content

### Phase 3: Enhanced Navigation
- Update navigation dots to show all 22 slides
- Add keyboard shortcuts for jumping between main topics
- Implement breadcrumb navigation showing current position

### Phase 4: Testing & Optimization
- Test all sub-slide transitions
- Verify animations work correctly
- Optimize for small screen performance

## üì± Small Screen Optimization Goals

- **Reduced Content Density:** Each screen shows focused, digestible content
- **Faster Navigation:** Users can quickly jump to specific concepts
- **Better Flow:** Logical progression through complex topics
- **Maintained Engagement:** Animations and interactions preserved per sub-slide
